# Goal:
  display the hotel deals in clear way using node js

# Thought process:
  - study the task's requirements.
  - study the response of the JSON API. see what I can use to build the site.
  - choose the framework: Node.js
      cause I'm most familiar with javascript, it's easy to install on my computer, and I have little experience with node.
  - build the server side first.
  - write test for server side code using chai and mocha.
  - build the view using jade.
  - style the view.
  - push and deploy.

# What I Learned:
  - node.js. "I have little experience with node.js"
  - testing using chai and mocha.
  - jade syntax.
  - deploying using heroku.
